# CS Concepts
exploring some fundamental concepts

## 01) Linked List
* Contains a node class, list class, and a runner file
* Singly Linked List
* The list object has various methods including a recursive method for reversing the list

## 02) Memoization
* showing the benefit of memoization by calculating numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
* benchmarking shows the delta
* example: find the 40th Fibonacci number
